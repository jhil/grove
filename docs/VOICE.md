## Voice Principles

### 1. Just Say It Simply
Don't dress things up. Say what it is.

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "Collaborate with team members" | "with friends" |
| "Your grove is waiting to bloom" | "no plants yet" |
| "Let's grow something beautiful together" | "add some plants" |
| "Optimize your watering schedule" | "so you don't forget" |
| "Unlock the power of" | just don't |

### 2. Chill, Not Urgent
No pressure. Ever.

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "Don't wait!" | (just don't say this) |
| "Get started NOW" | "start" |
| "Your plants miss you!" | "time to water" |
| "Ready to grow together?" | "make a grove" |

### 3. Low-Key About Good Things
Celebrate quietly. No confetti energy.

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "Amazing! You did it!" | "done" |
| "Congratulations on your new grove!" | "grove created" |
| "Your plants thank you!" | "watered" |

### 4. Skip the Flowery Language
Nature-themed is fine. Poetic is too much.

**Fine:** water, plants, grove, garden
**Skip:** bloom, flourish, nurture, blossom, thrive (unless genuinely fitting)

## Tone by Context

### Welcome/Onboarding
Low-key. Just orienting them.

> "this is your grove. add plants, share the link."

### Success States
Brief. Acknowledge, move on.

> "watered"
> "saved"
> "grove created"

### Error States
Honest, not cutesy. Don't overdo the "oops."

> "didn't work. try again?"
> "something broke"
> "couldn't save"

### Empty States
Just state the fact. Maybe a tiny nudge.

> "no plants yet"
> "nobody's watered today"
> "nothing here"

### Calls to Action
Verbs. Short.

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "Sign up now" | "sign up" |
| "Join the garden!" | "join" |
| "Start your journey" | "start" |

## The Vibe Check

Read your copy and ask: does this sound like a wellness brand, a tech startup, or a chill friend?

We want chill friend. Not inspirational. Not corporate. Just... normal.
